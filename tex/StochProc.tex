\subsection{Definition}
\begin{frame}
Intuitively, \textbf{stochastic processes} are $\infty$-dimensional probability distributions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item In most applications, stochastic processes model systems that evolve randomly in time, which is likely the origin of the word \emph{process} in the name. 
\item The order of this evolution can be described through the use of an index and an index set respectively $t \in T$.
\end{itemize}

\newtheorem{stpo}{Definition}
\begin{stpo}
Consider a random experiment with sample space $X$, a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$, a base probability measure $\mu : \Sigma \rightarrow [0,1]$, and a collection of random variables $S_t$ indexed by a set $T$. A \textbf{stochastic process} is then defined by the set $\{S_t, t \in T\}$.
\end{stpo}
\begin{itemize}
\item This definition can be specialized to the case of discrete or continuous stochastic processes by taking the index set to be $T \in \mathbb{N}$ or $T \in \mathbb{R}_+$ respectively.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
